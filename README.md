# 1-900-BAD-SEXT

My friends Maggie and Beth wanted a Twitter bot that could tweet out some bad
sexts. I bet that you could make some by just searching for already-existing
tweets containing a few key present-tense phrases and just drop "SEXT:" in
 front of it. These jokes literally write themselves.
 
## Dependencies

I took two steps to install the necessary libraries:

```
$ pip install tweepy
```

Here's what I got installed afterwards:

```
(badsext)primo:badsext brian$ pip freeze
oauthlib==1.0.3
requests==2.8.1
requests-oauthlib==0.5.0
six==1.10.0
tweepy==3.4.0
wsgiref==0.1.2
```
